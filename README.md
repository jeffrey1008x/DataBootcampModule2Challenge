# DataBootcampModule2Challenge
Module 2 Challenge for Data Bootcamp

The module was completed entirely by myself(Jeffrey Che) using the VBA guidlines from Microsoft official website: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/excel

The idea is to use dictionaries to hold the key information for each ticker in that year on each sheet of the workbooks.
Then calculate the required data using the dictionary and put them on the worksheets.
